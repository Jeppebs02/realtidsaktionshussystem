```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeppebs02/realtidsaktionshussystem.git
```

Then navigate to the following project directory:

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Using a Remote Database

1. **Update Environment Variable**  
   Set the `DatabaseConnectionString` environment variable to point to the correct remote database host.

2. **Prepare the Database**  
   Connect to your remote database and execute the following SQL scripts from the `SQL-Script` folder **in this order**:
   
   - `CreateDBAuction_V.2.sql`
   - `GenerateTestData.sql`

3. **Launch the Application**  
   Start the containers with the following command:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-db-remote-release.yml up -d
   ```

---

### Option 2: Using a Local Database

1. **No Configuration Needed**  
   The local database connection string is already pre-configured.

2. **Launch the Application**  
   Start the containers with:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-db-local-release.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Prepare the Database**  
   Run the same SQL scripts as the remote setup:
   
   - `CreateDBAuction_V.2.sql`
   - `GenerateTestData.sql`
